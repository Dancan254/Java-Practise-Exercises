1.Number In Word
Write a method called printNumberInWord. The method has one parameter number which is the whole number. 
The method needs to print "ZERO", "ONE", "TWO", ... "NINE", "OTHER" if the int parameter number is 0, 1, 2, .... 9 or other for any other number including negative numbers. 
You can use if-else statement or switch statement whatever is easier for you.

2. Number Of Days In Month
Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year. 

The parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999.

If the parameter is not in that range return false. 

Otherwise, if it is in the valid range, calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is, otherwise return false. 

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400.

Examples of input/output:

isLeapYear(-1600); →  should return false since the parameter is not in the range (1-9999)

isLeapYear(1600); → should return true since 1600 is a leap year

3. First And Last Digit Sum
Write a method named sumFirstAndLastDigit with one parameter of type int called number. 

The method needs to find the first and the last digit of the parameter number passed to the method, using a loop and return the sum of the first and the last digit of that number.

If the number is negative then the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

Example input/output

sumFirstAndLastDigit(252); → should return 4, the first digit is 2 and the last is 2 which gives us 2+2 and the sum is 4.


4. Greatest Common Divisor
Write a method named getGreatestCommonDivisor with two parameters of type int named first and second. 

If one of the parameters is < 10, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

The method should return the greatest common divisor of the two numbers (int).

The greatest common divisor is the largest positive integer that can fully divide each of the integers (i.e. without leaving a remainder).

For example 12 and 30:

12 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

30 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30

The greatest common divisor is 6 since both 12 and 30 can be divided by 6, and there is no resulting remainder.

4.Greatest Common Divisor
Write a method named getGreatestCommonDivisor with two parameters of type int named first and second. 

If one of the parameters is < 10, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

The method should return the greatest common divisor of the two numbers (int).

The greatest common divisor is the largest positive integer that can fully divide each of the integers (i.e. without leaving a remainder).

For example 12 and 30:

12 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

30 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30

The greatest common divisor is 6 since both 12 and 30 can be divided by 6, and there is no resulting remainder.


5. Number Of Days In Month
Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year. 

The parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999.

If the parameter is not in that range return false. 

Otherwise, if it is in the valid range, calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is, otherwise return false. 

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400.

Examples of input/output:

isLeapYear(-1600); →  should return false since the parameter is not in the range (1-9999)

isLeapYear(1600); → should return true since 1600 is a leap year

isLeapYear(2017); → should return false since 2017 is not a leap year

isLeapYear(2000); → should return true because 2000 is a leap year
